As a teenager in Mexico, I played basketball and rocked my guitar with a few local bands. These experiences taught me to persevere and how to be a team player. The skills I instilled growing up are evident as I grow my professional career as a data scientist.

During my professional career as a data scientist and engineer, I have not only revamped my soft skills, but I have also demonstrated competitiveness using my analytical and technical skills in several projects and an internship at LinkedIn.

To me data science is a field that requires:
  * Great technical skills and adaptability to new technologies
  * Impeccable communication and leadership skills 
  * Demonstrate curiosity and initiative

Accomplishments that demonstrate my expertise in the above categories are:
  * Wrote efficient queries to identify customer’s acquisition and spending behaviors from 100M+ records; used analysis to obtain buy-in for plan that established the department’s marketing strategy baseline
  * Created a community college initiative to grow the numbers of Hispanic in STEM transferring to 4-year universities
  * Received the SHPE Technical Achievement Recognition: Student Role Model of the Year, which is the highest award to an undergraduate student from SHPE at a National Level

Opportunities that allow me to find meaningful insights from data trigger my curiosity, and I strive to find immediate actions for business partners to accomplish business goals.

Specialties: Data science, statistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, predictive modeling, python, SQL, six sigma, and visualizations
